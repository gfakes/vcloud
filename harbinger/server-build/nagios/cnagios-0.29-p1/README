 Welcome to Cnagios!

 Cnagios is a full-screen terminal interface for viewing Nagios HOST
 and SERVICE objects, and the durations of their current states.  It's 
 lightning fast because it's written in C using the curses library.
 And it's super flexible because it uses the perl C library to shorten 
 and alter host, service and plugin output and filter the displayed 
 HOSTs or SERVICEs.

 To use Cnagios, you'll need Unix, nagios, perl and the curses (or 
 ncurses) libraries.

 To configure, build and install Cnagios, do...

   ./configure
   make
   make install

 If you want to install cnagios and it's man page in /usr/local then
 do "make install2".

 To run Cnagios, add "/usr/local/nagios/bin" to your PATH (or copy
 cnagios into /usr/bin) and do...

   cnagios

 If you don't like the full-color display, try...

   cnagios -b

 To launch Cnagios from your window manager, configure it to run
 color Cnagios in a wide xterm terminal with no scroll bar... my
 favorite invocation is...

   xterm +sb -geom 100x35 -rv -e \
    /usr/local/nagios/bin/cnagios -s a -A 4h

 To modify the default/start-up configuration of cnagios, edit
 the /usr/local/nagios/etc/cnagiosrc and/or ~/.cnagiosrc file(s).

 You can also create permanent text (grep like) filters or negative 
 (grep -v like) filters by editing the /usr/local/nagios/etc/cnagiosrc 
 and/or ~/.cnagiosrc file(s).  These filters are perl regular expressions.  
 For example, the entry...

   f3 text =~ /IMAP|SMTP/

 and hitting the "F3" key will cause cnagios to only display objects
 matching "IMAP" or "SMTP".

 To modify host, service and plugin output, edit the perl code in...

   /usr/local/nagios/etc/cnagios.pl

 Refer to...

  ftp://noc.hep.wisc.edu/pub/src/cnagios/cnagios.pl

 for lots of examples.

 If you have any questions, comments or suggestions for enhancements
 to Cnagios, don't hesitate to contact me: <rader@hep.wisc.edu>
