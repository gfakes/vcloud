.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcnagios\fR
is a full-screen terminal interface for viewing Nagios
HOST and SERVICE objects, and the durations of their current states.
.LP
It's quite fast, much faster than the Nagios web interface,
because it's written in C using the curses library. 
And it's very flexible, because it uses hooks directly
into the Perl C library to shorten host, service and plugin output,
and also filter the displayed HOSTs or SERVICEs.
.LP
The following summarizes the options:
.nf
-A <age>         filter UP/OKAY objects by age less than <age>
-a <age>         filter objects by age less than <age>
-b               display in black and white
-d               print debug info to stderr
-g /perl_regex/  filter host/service/plugin-output with /perl_regex/
-h               print (this) usage info
-i <integer>     set polling interval to <integer> seconds (default is 90)
-l <u|d|o|w|c>   display objects with UP/DOWN/OK/WARNING/CRITICAL status
-m <h|s>         display HOST objects or SERVICE objects
-P <integer>     set header padding to <integer> (default is 2)
-p <integer>     set row/column padding to <integer> (default is 1)
-s <n|a>         sort objects by-name or by-age
-V               print version and exit
-v /perl_regex/  negative filter host/service/plugin-output with /perl_regex/
